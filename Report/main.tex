\section*{\textcolor{red}{Introduction}}
\label{sec:introduction}
An Abstract Data Type in data structures is a kind of data type whose behaviour is defined with the help of some attributes and some functions. Generally, we write these attributes and functions inside a class or a structure so that we can use an object of the class to use that particular abstract data type. Graph is an abstract data structure. They are mathematical data structures that are useful for solving many kinds of problems in computer science
\\
\\
A graph is a relation on a finite set of vertices. Two vertices are related if there is an edge between them. If V and E denote the set of vertices and edges, the graph is represented as G(V, E).

\\
\\
There are several types of graphs in data structures. These include undirected, directed, weighted, multi, complete, simple, bipartite, and cyclic graphs. In our library, we have focused mainly on weighted and unweighted directed and undirected graphs.
\\
\begin{itemize}  
\item[--] Unweighted Graph: No value associated with the edges
\item[--] Weighted Graph: Whose edges have values. All the values associated with the edges are called weights.
\item[--] Undirected Graph: All edges are bidirectional
\item[--] Directed Graph: All edges are directed from one node to the other.
\\
\end{itemize}  

Graphs can be represented using either an Adjacency list or an Adjacency matrix. In our library, weâ€™ve used adjacency list representation of graphs because it is more space efficient. In the adjacency list representation, each node is mapped to a list of all its adjacencies or neighbours.
\\
\\
All classes, functions and variable names are lower\_case\_underscore. Our library provides the following graph types:
\\
\begin{itemize}  
\item[--] \begin{verbatim}
graph
\end{verbatim}

This class implements an undirected graph. It assumes multiple edges between two nodes are not added. It does allow self-loop edges between a node and itself.

\item[--]\begin{verbatim}
digraph
\end{verbatim} 

Directed graphs, that is, graphs with directed edges. Provides operations common to directed graphs.

\item[--] \begin{verbatim}
wgraph
\end{verbatim}

Weighted undirected graphs. Allows only integer weights to the edges.
\item[--] \begin{verbatim}
wdigraph
\end{verbatim}

Weighted directed graphs. Allows only integer weights to the edges.
\\
\end{itemize}  
All graph classes allow any object as node such as \texttt{char, int, string }and more. Only int weights are allowed in wgraph and wdigraph classes.
\\
\\
The graph internal data structures are based on an adjacency list representation and implemented using map data structures. In unweighted graphs, each node in the adjacency list is mapped to a list (vector) of its neighbours. In weighted graphs, each node is mapped to a vector of pairs in which the first attribute is the neighbour of that node and the second attribute is the weight of the edge connecting it to that node.

\\
\\
% \begin{verbatim}
% \section{Title of the section}
% \end{verbatim}
% The numbering can be turned off by using \verb|\section*{}|.
% A new subsection is created by the command
% \begin{verbatim}
% \subsection{Title of the subsection}
% \end{verbatim}
% and, similarly, the numbering can be turned off by adding an asterisk as follows 
% \begin{verbatim}
% \subsection*{}
% \end{verbatim}
% It is recommended to give a label to each section by using the command
% \begin{verbatim}
% \label{sec:section_name}%
% \end{verbatim}
% where the argument is just a text string that you'll use to reference that part
% as follows: \textit{Section~\ref{sec:introduction} contains \sc{INTRODUCTION}  \dots}.

\subsubsection*{\textcolor{blue}{ \Large \texttt{graph::bfs}}}
It performs Breadth-First Search traversal on a given graph with given source vertex s.



\subsubsection*{\textcolor{blue}{ \large {Syntax}}}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
std::vector<T> bfs(T s);


\end{lstlisting}
\subsubsection*{\textcolor{blue}{ \large {Parameters
}}}
s\\
Source vertex

\subsubsection*{\textcolor{blue}{ \large {Return Value}}}
Returns a vector containing the bfs traversal starting from source vertex s.

\subsubsection*{\textcolor{blue}{ \large {Algorithm}}}
The BFS algorithm is defined as follows:
\begin{enumerate}  
\item Consider an undirected graph with vertices numbered from 1 to n. Initialise queue q as a new queue containing only vertex s, and mark the vertex s as visited.

 
\item Extract a vertex v from the head of the queue q.

\item Store vertex v in bfs traversal.

\item Iterate in arbitrary order through all such vertices u that u is a neighbour of v and is not marked yet as visited. Mark the vertex u as visited and insert it into the tail of the queue q.
\item If the queue is not empty, continue from step 2.
\item Otherwise, return the bfs traversal of the graph.
\end{enumerate}  

\subsubsection*{\textcolor{blue}{ \large {Time Complexity}}}
For regular bfs, the time complexity is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. However, because of the map implementation of the adjacency list, it becomes O(V log V + E)

It performs Depth First Search traversal on a given graph with a given source vertex u.

\end{lstlisting}
\subsubsection*{\textcolor{blue}{ \large {Parameters
}}}
u\\
Source vertex


\subsubsection*{\textcolor{blue}{ \large {Return Value}}}
Returns a vector containing the dfs traversal starting from source vertex u.


\subsubsection*{\textcolor{blue}{ \large {Algorithm}}}
The recursive implementation of DFS is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}  
\item Start the search at one vertex.
\item After visiting that vertex, we perform a DFS for each adjacent vertex we haven't visited before.
\item This way, we visit all vertices that are reachable from the starting vertex.

\end{enumerate}  
The iterative implementation of DFS is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}  
\item Initialise stack s as a new stack containing only vertex u, and mark the vertex u as visited.
\item Extract v from the top of the stack s.

\item Store vertex v in the dfs traversal.
\item Iterate in arbitrary order through all such vertices u that u is a neighbour of v and is not marked yet as visited. Mark the vertex u as visited and push it into the stack s.
\item If the stack is not empty, continue from step 2.
\item Otherwise, return the dfs traversal of the graph.

\end{enumerate}

O(V log V + E)

Checks whether the graph contains a cycle or not
\subsubsection*{\textcolor{blue}{ \large {Syntax}}}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
bool cyclic();
\end{lstlisting}
\subsubsection*{\textcolor{blue}{ \large {Return Value}}}
Returns true if the graph is cyclic, else returns false
\subsubsection*{\textcolor{blue}{ \large {Algorithm}}}
It uses DFS to check for cyclicity.

\begin{enumerate}  
\item Initially all vertices are unvisited.
\item Construct a data structure to store parents (In our implementation, we use a map).
\item For each unvisited node, run DFS and update the parent map.
\item If DFS discovers a visited node, then we have found a cycle and return true.

\item Otherwise return false.
\end{enumerate}  
The parent map can be used the print the cycle found.


\subsubsection*{\textcolor{blue}{ \large {Time Complexity}}}
Since this algorithm will not run on the same vertex twice, its time complexity will be same as that of dfs, that is O(V log V + E)

\end{lstlisting}
\subsubsection*{\textcolor{blue}{ \large {Return Value}}}
Returns true if the graph is bipartite, else returns false
\subsubsection*{\textcolor{blue}{ \large {Algorithm}}}
The algorithm uses the fact that a graph is bipartite if and only if it is two-colorable. Here, use BFS to traverse the graph.
\begin{enumerate}  
\item For each unvisited vertex assign it one colour, say blue and assign all itâ€™s neighbours the opposite colour, say red.
\item When the neighbour of a vertex has already been visited, we check whether its colour is opposite to the current node or not. If yes, continue from step 1, else return false.
\item Finally if all the vertices have been visited, we conclude that the graph is bipartite and return true.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
std::vector<T> topological_sort();




\end{lstlisting}
\subsubsection*{\textcolor{blue}{ \large {Return Value}}}
Returns a vector containing a topological sort of the given directed graph. As a topological sort is possible only for a DAG, if the graph contains cycles it returns an empty vector.





\subsubsection*{\textcolor{blue}{ \large {Algorithm}}}
It uses Kahnâ€™s algorithm to find a topological sort of the given DAG.
\begin{enumerate}  
\item Initialise a queue q with all the nodes whose in degree is 0.
\item Extract vertex v from the front of the queue.
\item Add v to the topological order list.
\item Decrement the in degree of all its neighbours by 1. If the in degree of some node becomes 0, insert it into the tail of the queue.

\item If the queue is not empty continue from step 2.
\item Otherwise, return the topological order list if it contains all the nodes else return an empty list.

\end{enumerate} 
\subsubsection*{\textcolor{blue}{ \large {Time Complexity}}}
Since this algorithm will not run on the same vertex twice, its time complexity is calculated in a way similar to bfs, that is O(V log V + E).

\subsubsection*{\textcolor{blue}{ \large {Algorithm
}}}
It uses Kosaraju's algorithm to find SCCs of the given Directed graph
\begin{enumerate}  
\item Create an empty stack S and do dfs traversal of the graph.
\item  In dfs traversal, after calling the recursive dfs for adjacent vertices of a vertex, push the vertex to the stack. This will store all the vertices in the stack in order of their finishing times.

\item Reverse directions of all edges to obtain the transpose graph.

\item  One by one, pop the top vertex from S while S is not empty. Perform the dfs traversal assuming the popped vertex as source.

\item The dfs starting from the popped vertex will give the strongly connected components of the popped vertex
\end{enumerate}  
\\
\subsubsection*{\textcolor{blue}{ \large {Time Complexity}}}
Since it performs dfs which takes O(V+E) and then reversing the graph also takes O(V+E), so time complexity of this algorithm is O(V+E).

\subsubsection*{\textcolor{blue}{ \large {Return Value}}}
Returns a list of lists or, more precisely, a vector of vectors containing shortest distances from every vertex to every other vertex for the given directed graph.

\subsubsection*{\textcolor{blue}{ \large {Algorithms}}}
Our implementation of bellman ford algorithm is described as follows:
\begin{enumerate}  
\item Perform the following operations for every vertex of the graph taking them as source.

\item Initialise distance from the source to all vertices as infinite and distance to the source itself as zero.


\item Create a map dist which stores all vertices as keys and sets their distances as infinite except dist[src], where src is the source vertex.
\item Do this operation |V| -1 times, it will calculate the the shortest distances.
\item[--] If dist[v] > dist[u] + weight of edge uv, then update dist[v] to dist[v] = dist[u] + weight of edge uv.
\item Again traverse every edge and do following for each u-v 
\item[--]  If dist[v] > dist[u] + weight of edge uv, then graph contains Negative weight cycle

\subsubsection*{\textcolor{blue}{ \large {Return Value}}}
Returns a map that maps all vertices to their shortest distance from the starting vertex.
\subsubsection*{\textcolor{blue}{ \large {Remarks}}}
The algorithm will work if and only if the weights of all edges are non-negative.
\subsubsection*{\textcolor{blue}{ \large {Algorithms}}}
Our implementation of dijkstraâ€™s algorithm is described as follows:
\begin{enumerate}  
\item Create a map of predecessors and a map of distances. Initialize the map of distances with infinity (INT\_MAX). Set distance of the starting vertex s from itself as 0.
\item Create a min priority queue q of pairs in which the first attribute is distance from s and the second attribute is a graph node. Initialize it with {0, s}.

\item Extract the v and d\_v (distance of v from s)  from the top of the min priority queue q. If the queue is empty, halt and continue from step 6.
\item If d\_v and d[v] (distance map) are equal, halt and continue from step 3, otherwise continue.
\item For all neighbours e of v, if d[v] + weight of edge {v, e} / (v, e) (for wdigraph) is less than distance of e from s than update the distance of e from s. Push the pair of distance of e from s and e in the priority queue q. Update predecessor of e to v.
\item Finally, return d.

\end{enumerate}  
\subsubsection*{\textcolor{blue}{ \large {Time Complexity}}}
Time complexity depends on finding vertex with smallest distance from s and the time taken for updating distance map. The time complexity is O(E log V).

% \section{Equations}
% \label{sec:eqs}
% This section gives some examples of writing mathematical equations in your thesis.

% Maxwell's equations read:
% \begin{subequations}
%     \label{eq:maxwell}
%     \begin{align}[left=\empheqlbrace]
%     \nabla\cdot \bm{D} & = \rho, \label{eq:maxwell1} \\
%     \nabla \times \bm{E} +  \frac{\partial \bm{B}}{\partial t} & = \bm{0}, \label{eq:maxwell2} \\
%     \nabla\cdot \bm{B} & = 0, \label{eq:maxwell3} \\
%     \nabla \times \bm{H} - \frac{\partial \bm{D}}{\partial t} &= \bm{J}. \label{eq:maxwell4}
%     \end{align}
% \end{subequations}

% Equation~\eqref{eq:maxwell} is automatically labeled by \texttt{cleveref},
% as well as Equation~\eqref{eq:maxwell1} and Equation~\eqref{eq:maxwell3}.
% Thanks to the \verb|cleveref| package, there is no need to use \verb|\eqref|.
% Equations have to be numbered only if they are referenced in the text.

% Equations~\eqref{eq:maxwell_multilabels1}, \eqref{eq:maxwell_multilabels2}, \eqref{eq:maxwell_multilabels3}, and \eqref{eq:maxwell_multilabels4} show again Maxwell's equations without brace:
% \begin{align}
%     \nabla\cdot \bm{D} & = \rho, \label{eq:maxwell_multilabels1} \\
%     \nabla \times \bm{E} +  \frac{\partial \bm{B}}{\partial t} &= \bm{0}, \label{eq:maxwell_multilabels2} \\
%     \nabla\cdot \bm{B} & = 0, \label{eq:maxwell_multilabels3} \\
%     \nabla \times \bm{H} - \frac{\partial \bm{D}}{\partial t} &= \bm{J} \label{eq:maxwell_multilabels4}.
% \end{align}

% Equation~\eqref{eq:maxwell_singlelabel} is the same as before,
% but with just one label:
% \begin{equation}
%     \label{eq:maxwell_singlelabel}
%     \left\{
%     \begin{aligned}
%     \nabla\cdot \bm{D} & = \rho, \\
%     \nabla \times \bm{E} +  \frac{\partial \bm{B}}{\partial t} &= \bm{0},\\
%     \nabla\cdot \bm{B} & = 0, \\
%     \nabla \times \bm{H} - \frac{\partial \bm{D}}{\partial t} &= \bm{J}.
%     \end{aligned}
%     \right.
% \end{equation}

% For including pictures in your text you can use \texttt{TikZ} for high-quality hand-made figures \cite{tikz},
% or just include them with the command

%     \caption{Caption of the Figure.}
%     \label{fig:quadtree}
% \end{figure}

% Thanks to the \texttt{\textbackslash subfloat} command, a single figure, such as Figure~\ref{fig:quadtree},
% can contain multiple sub-figures with their own caption and label, e.g. Figure~\ref{fig:first_img} and Figure~\ref{fig:second_img}.

%     \label{fig:quadtree2}
% \end{figure}

% \subsection{Tables}
% \label{subsec:tables}

% Within the environments \texttt{table} and  \texttt{tabular} you can create very fancy tables as the one shown in Table~\ref{table:example}.

In this project, we have created a library which provides data structures for graphs, digraphs, weighted graphs and related algorithms. It will be very useful for studying and analyzing sparse graphs. It can be used to simulate  graphs problems such as Sudoku, Snakes \& Ladders and many other realÂ lifeÂ problems.
